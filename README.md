# Image Optimizer

A simple and efficient Python script for optimizing your images in bulk before uploading to your site. This script uses the PIL (Pillow) library to reduce the size of images without significant loss of quality so that your site loads faster.

## Features

- Easy to use: Just select your input and output directories, and set your desired quality.
- Supports JPEG images: Works with `.jpg` and `.jpeg` files.
- Customizable quality: You decide the balance between size and quality.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the Pillow library with pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```
3. If you're using Linux, you might need to install the tkinter library separately, as it's not always included with Python on Linux distributions. On Ubuntu, you can install tkinter with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
